# Assets guide — images, thumbnails and videos

This file explains where media files live in the project and how to update/replace them.

Folders
- `public/imagenes/` — general photos used by the site (hero images, gallery photos, etc.).
- `public/sucursales/` — photos for each sucursal and generated thumbnails.
- `public/videos/` — place MP4/WebM/AV1 files used by the About page video player.

Naming and conventions
- Sucursales images: use a slug-friendly name, e.g. `fidel_velazquez.jpg` or `fidel_velazquez.avif`.
- Thumbnails: generated by `scripts/generate-sucursales-thumbnails.js` and written as
  `public/sucursales/thumb-<slug>.avif` and `public/sucursales/thumb-<slug>.webp`.
  The app prefers `.avif` then `.webp`, then falls back to a remote staticmap if none exist.
- About page video: name the files with a common base (`hero.mp4`, `hero.webm`) and set `srcBase="hero"` in `src/app/about/page.tsx` (see code comments).

How to replace an image
1. Add your image file to the appropriate folder (`public/sucursales/` or `public/imagenes/`).
2. If the image filename changed, update the reference in `src/app/data/sucursales.ts` (for sucursales) or in the component that references the image (for other pages).
3. If you added/changed sucursales coordinates or want a fresh thumbnail, run the thumbnail generator (see below).

Generate thumbnails (local)
1. Install `sharp` (if not already present):
   ```powershell
   pnpm add -D sharp
   ```

2. Run the generator from repo root:
   ```powershell
   pnpm run generate:thumbnails
   # or
   node .\scripts\generate-sucursales-thumbnails.js
   ```

Notes and tips
- If you prefer to provide your own thumbnails instead of generating them, place `thumb-<slug>.avif` and/or `thumb-<slug>.webp` in `public/sucursales/` with the same naming pattern.
- For best performance, upload optimized AVIF/WebP images sized to the thumbnail dimensions (300×150 by default) and optimized for web.
- If you use retina assets, consider adding `thumb-<slug>@2x.avif` and update components to prefer them based on devicePixelRatio (not implemented by default).
 - Retina assets: to support high-DPI screens, add `@2x` variants following the pattern:
    `thumb-<slug>@2x.avif` and `thumb-<slug>@2x.webp`.
    The UI uses a <picture> element and `srcSet` so browsers will automatically
    choose the `@2x` file when available.

If anything in this guide is unclear or you'd like me to generate replacement thumbnails for a different size, tell me the desired size and I can update the generator accordingly.
